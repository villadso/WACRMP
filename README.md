### Western Arlington County Rainfall Measurement Project
## R Scripts

The associated R Scripts are for use with the Western Arlington County Rainfall Measurement Project (WACRMP), which is the author’s final project for INSC 546 Environmental Informatics at the University of Tennessee—Knoxville (UT) School of Information Sciences (SIS).

The Western Arlington County Rainfall Measurement Project (WACRMP) was designed to measure the quantity of rainfall at a designated site in western Arlington County, Virginia from September 1, 2015 to November 20, 2015 and compare these measurements to the quantity of rainfall collected by 11 other rainfall collection sites in the northern Virginia and Washington DC metropolitan area. These 11 sites are located within several miles of western Arlington County, where there is a gap in rainfall coverage by existing rainfall collection sites associated with the National Weather Service.

The results can be used to determine the daily and monthly variation in rainfall between western Arlington County and other areas in Northern Virginia and the Washington DC area and potentially inform the need for a new rainfall collection site, possibly under the auspices of the National Weather Service (NWS) Co-operative Observer (COOP) network, to be established in western Arlington County to measure rainfall and other precipitation on a year-round basis.
